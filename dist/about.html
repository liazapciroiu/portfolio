      <p>I was fortunate enough to work alongside a vocational counselor and learn that besides doing what you love the important thing that gets you long term satisfaction is to have the kind of job that matches your personality â€“ also that way you are a lot more competent effortlessly. <br>
        I've always been a methodical, very organised creative. The type that would do handmade jewelry with an excel spreadsheet opened so I know the beads, time and costs :) This, and the fact that I enjoy nothing more then the continuous learning and improvement of my skills lead to my decision to become a &nbsp;front-end developer, so I can have a life-time of what suits me.</p>

      <h3>Coders Lab</h3>
      <h4>Front-end bootcamp</h4>
      <p>A very intensive programming course for 7 weeks, 8h/day and an exam for every module to stay in the program. The combo of theory with practical examples in the class and much more complex exercises for solving on my own daily was a very efficient way of building a solid foundation for web development.<br> Here I used Webstorm IDE, Git for version control and Linux - Ubuntu as my OS to study the technologies that I'm now using in my portfolio of applications.</p>

      <h4>Human resources</h4>
      <p>
        While working as an IT recruiter for a large company I discovered that I was much more curious about coding challenges my colleagues encounter or understanding at a technical level the job descriptions.
        And after coding the first little game where I got to do DOM Manipulation, use functions, loops and conditionals to actually make the software work properly I was hooked and left my job to focused entirely on my new career path.</p>
