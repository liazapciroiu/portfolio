## Personal portfolio website
##### https://liazapciroiu.github.io/portfolio/

I made this project to better grasp the concepts and technologies that I’ve learned at Coders Lab, to work at a final product that is a full website, with multiple pages, animations, responsive and of course, to showcase what I will develop next.
#
I have two favorite parts about this project, the first one is the use of Sass for a very quick complete change of the site – using variables for the primary and second color, I defined a function that checks if the background is light, the color of the text will be dark and vice versa. This gives me a ton of flexibility and if a client wants to temporary change the mood of his site (e.g. for a big sale) I can change only two lines of code and everything else will adapt accordingly. 

The second one is that I made the transitions for the menu change at a breaking point. So, when a user is on a large screen the overlays come from top and bottom and for screens 768 pixels or smaller the transition changes and the overlays come from the sides to stack up.
